### **_Description_**

brtr functions as a simulated buy / sell platform for any type of item. You can tell how cool and hip and 2010s we are by the lack of vowels in our name.

Users can browse as a guest or create an account for the full experience. With an account users will be able to list and sell thier items and buy other users items.

A post MVP version sees reviews for both users and items, credit card processing, user and product reviews, and a barter system to trade items instead of using money.

- Delete - user can delete thier own creations
